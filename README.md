## Description

 This project will let you choose between fractals. Once you do that, it will generate the fractal in real-time, and zoom into it as your computer renders the frames

## How to Use it

 Using this is pretty simple. To select the fractal you want, you just click on it and select, "draw fractal". then you just wait and look at the fractal zoom in at an interesting point.

## Which fractals does this have

Currently, it has mandelbrot, a few julia sets, burning ship, tricorn, and some mandelbrot variations.
